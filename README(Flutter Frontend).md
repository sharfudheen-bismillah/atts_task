# 🛒 Atts Super Market App

Hey there! Welcome to the Atts Super Market app. This little gem is built with Flutter and is here to make running a supermarket a breeze. Let's dive in!

## 🚀 What's This All About?

Ever wished managing a supermarket could be as easy as pie? Well, that's what we're aiming for! This app helps you:

- Keep track of your inventory (no more "oops, we're out of stock" moments)
- Process sales like a pro
- Generate bills that even your grandma could understand


## 🏗️ What's Under the Hood?

Here's a quick tour of our app's structure:

- `lib/`: This is where the magic happens
  - `main.dart`: The app's starting point (like the first page of a good book)
  - `splash_screen.dart`: A fancy loading screen to impress your customers
  - `drawer_widget.dart`: A neat drawer for easy navigation
  - `drawer/`: Where all our main features live
    - `inventory/`: Everything about managing your stock
    - `sale/`: Where the money-making happens!

## 🛠️ Getting Started

Want to take it for a spin? Here's how:

1. Make sure you've got Flutter installed (if not, time to join the Flutter party!)
2. Clone this bad boy: `git clone [insert-your-repo-url-here]`
3. Jump into the project: `cd atts-super-market`
4. Get all the goodies: `flutter pub get`
5. Fire it up: `flutter run`


## 🧰 Tools We're Using

We're standing on the shoulders of giants here. Big thanks to:

- Flutter (our main squeeze)
- Firebase (for all that backend magic)
- Google Fonts (because ugly fonts make customers sad)


## 🔥 Firebase Setup

We're using Firebase to handle all the behind-the-scenes stuff. Make sure you:

1. Set up a Firebase project (it's easier than setting up a tent, promise)
2. Grab those config files and pop them where they belong:
   1. `google-services.json` for Android folks
   2. `GoogleService-Info.plist` for the iOS crowd

## 📱 Flutter Frontend

Our frontend is built with Flutter, a UI toolkit that helps us create natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Here are some key points about our Flutter implementation:

- We're using the latest stable version of Flutter (check `pubspec.yaml` for the exact version)
- The app follows Material Design principles for a sleek, modern look
- We've implemented responsive layouts to ensure the app looks great on various screen sizes
- State management is handled using [insert your chosen state management solution, e.g., Provider, Riverpod, Bloc]
- Custom widgets are located in the `lib/widgets/` directory for easy reuse across the app


## 🚀 Release Commands

### Android (APK)

To build an APK for Android:

\`\`\`shellscript
flutter build apk --release
\`\`\`

The APK will be located at `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`.

### iOS (IPA)

For iOS, you'll need to use Xcode on a Mac:

1. Open the iOS project in Xcode:

\`\`\`shellscript
open ios/Runner.xcworkspace
\`\`\`

2. In Xcode, select `Product > Archive`
3. Once the archive is created, click on `Distribute App`
4. Follow the prompts to create the IPA file


### Windows

To build for Windows:

\`\`\`shellscript
flutter build windows --release
\`\`\`

The executable will be located in `build/windows/runner/Release/`.
